# Web Crawler

A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering). [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler)

I built this tool for offline website enumeration purpose. This tool can also be used as a simple downloader.
